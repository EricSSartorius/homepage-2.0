      <p>Life is short and I want to see how much I can explore and learn before I die! If you are curious about how I have time to code, design, model, study languages, and workout all while traveling the world, check out my <a href="http://iamtheepic.com">travel blog.</a></p>
      <p>Looking for front-end development help on a project? Or perhaps a model for your brand? Want to get in shape and looking for a movement coach? I have experience freelancing in all of these fields so feel free to <Link to="/contact/">shoot me a message</Link> so we can talk more about your needs!</p>

          <h3>Web Development And UI/UX Design</h3>
          <p>I have 5 years of experience with web development and design. Most of my recent projects are done in React. My specialty is making blazing fast e-commerce static sites with Gatsby and Shopify. Although I mostly do front-end programming, I also have experience creating mockups in Sketch and Figma.</p>

          <h3>Modeling</h3>
          <p>I started modeling part-time in 2008. The majority of my work was product modeling at first but I later moved on to runway shows, event promotions, tv appearances, and extra work in movies.</p>

          <h3>Movement Coaching</h3>
          <p>I am now well into my 30s yet never seemed to have outgrown my days at the playground. I have over 15 years experience in breakdancing, 5 years in calesthenic training, as well as  experience in capoeira, acrobatics, stunt work, pole dancing, boxing, brazillian jujitsu, tricking, gymnastics, and parkour. I would love to help anyone else that wants to test the limits of their body and move like they never have before.</p>

          <h3>Translation</h3>
          <p>After studying abroad in Japan in 2004, I realized I had a passion for learning languages. I then went on to major in Japanese, live in Japan for 4 years, and then move to Korea for 6 years and learn Korean. During my time abroad, I had many opportunities to do freelance translation, interpretation, and subtitling work.</p>
